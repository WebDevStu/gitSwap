# Git Swap

Project is WIP - currently reads and writes a .gitconfigbak file, just cp your orginal .gitconfig file to get this to work.

Idea came from <a href="https://github.com/joealba/gitswitch">https://github.com/joealba/gitswitch</a>, a ruby git profile switcher.

This project has come out of my annoying habit of committing to my personal repos with my work account and more embarrassingly committing to my work repos with my personal account.
 
@TODO
* sort out the file crud, duplicate logic
* organise the flow
* error handling
